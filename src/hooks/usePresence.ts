/**
 * usePresence is a React hook for reading & writing presence data.
 *
 * The data is written by various users, and comes back as a list of data for
 * other users in the same room. It is not meant for mission-critical data, but
 * rather for optimistic metadata, like whether a user is online, typing, or
 * at a certain location on a page. The data is single-flighted, and when many
 * updates are requested while an update is in flight, only the latest data will
 * be sent in the next request. See for more details on single-flighting:
 * https://stack.convex.dev/throttling-requests-by-single-flighting
 *
 * Data updates are merged with previous data. This data will reflect all
 * updates, not just the data that gets synchronized to the server. So if you
 * update with {mug: userMug} and {typing: true}, the data will have both
 * `mug` and `typing` fields set, and will be immediately reflected in the data
 * returned as the first parameter.
 *
 * @param room - The location associated with the presence data. Examples:
 * page, chat channel, game instance.
 * @param user - The user associated with the presence data.
 * @param initialData - The initial data to associate with the user.
 * @param heartbeatPeriod? - If specified, the interval between heartbeats, in
 * milliseconds. A heartbeat updates the user's presence "updated" timestamp.
 * The faster the updates, the more quickly you can detect a user "left" at
 * the cost of more server function calls.
 * @returns A list with 1. this user's data; 2. A list of other users' data;
 * 3. function to update this user's data. It will do a shallow merge.
